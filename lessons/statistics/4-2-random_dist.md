[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

'''
Exercise: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?
Solution goes here

'''
the probability of every value is 1/1000 or .001 which makes sence given that every value is unique.  The histogram (pmf) with 5 bins shows a flat distribution at 1000/5=200 as we'd expect. However as we increase the bins to 100 the continous data would show tremendous noise indicating continuous data with no trend.

A strait diagonal show this uniform distribution between 0-1 as we'd expect.
